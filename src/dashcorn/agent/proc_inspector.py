worker_inspector

This module provides utilities for inspecting the current Python process and its
Uvicorn or Gunicorn worker subprocesses. It is designed for environments where
applications are served using Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers (such as FastAPI apps)
and enables basic process-level monitoring and metrics collection.

Main functionalities:
- Gather runtime information about the current process.
- Detect and collect metrics from subprocesses running Uvicorn or Gunicorn.
- Aggregate a summary of all relevant worker metrics for monitoring purposes.

Functions:
    - get_self_process_info() -> Dict:
        Returns detailed process metrics for the current (master) process.

    - find_uvicorn_workers(master_pid: int = None) -> List[Dict]:
        Detects Uvicorn or Gunicorn worker subprocesses spawned by the given master PID.

    - get_all_worker_metrics() -> Dict:
        Returns a summary including the master process info and its active Uvicorn workers.

Dependencies:
    - psutil: Used for process inspection and metric collection.
    - os: For retrieving the current process ID.

Example usage:
    >>> from worker_inspector import get_all_worker_metrics
    >>> metrics = get_all_worker_metrics()
    >>> print(metrics["num_workers"])
    4

This module is useful for lightweight observability in production Python web services.
