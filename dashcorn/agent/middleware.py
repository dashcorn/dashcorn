"""
metrics_middleware

This module provides an ASGI middleware for tracking HTTP request metrics in
Starlette or FastAPI applications. It captures key data about each request such as:

- HTTP method
- Request path
- Response status code
- Processing duration (in seconds)
- Timestamp when the request completed

The collected metrics are sent using ZeroMQ to a monitoring server via the `send_metric`
function, defined in the `zmq_client` module.

Classes:
    - MetricsMiddleware: A subclass of Starlette's BaseHTTPMiddleware that wraps
      incoming requests to log and forward timing metrics.

Example:
    from metrics_middleware import MetricsMiddleware

    app.add_middleware(MetricsMiddleware)

Dependencies:
    - time: For high-resolution duration measurement and timestamps.
    - starlette.middleware.base.BaseHTTPMiddleware: For ASGI middleware structure.
    - system_reporter.start_background_reporter: System reporter.
    - zmq_client.send_metric: For sending metrics to an external observer.

This middleware is intended for use in performance monitoring, request tracking,
and operational observability.
